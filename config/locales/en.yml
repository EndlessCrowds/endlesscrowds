      title_magic: "Our magic formula"
      magic: "We believe that providing a meeting place for people that share common values is the best way to turn projects into reality. Use EndlessCrowds as a channel to direct your network towards a COMMON objective."
      title_money: "Where does the money to finance projects come from?"
      money: "At least 50% will come from your own network of contacts. In this manner, EndlessCrowds is a way for you to get closer to the people that enjoy your work and expand this network through sharing in social networks, newspapers, blogs and, of course, your favorite bar."
      title_work: "Does it take a lot of work?"
      work: "Yes! There is no easy money on the internet. You will have to work a lot during your project, but the experience will be worth it - we assure you - and you will also have a much stronger network behind your project after EndlessCrowds."
      title_costs: "How much does it cost to use EndlessCrowds?"
      costs: "Submitting your project is free. When your project is approved and has reached its goal, EndlessCrowds will apply a 6% fee."
      why: "Why EndlessCrowds?"
      intro: "First of all, we believe strongly that crowdfunding is a new and better way to finance amazing projects."
      why_one: "By creating a very strong bond with your network, you will open doors to new projects, partnerships and other unexpected connections."
      why_two: "If the projects are well done, they can spread quickly to a lot of people, expanding your network and strengthening the base of people around your project."
      why_three: "Minimum red tape and low financial risk. No interest rate, no entry fees... and lots of fun."
    guidelines_tips:
      title: "Almost there!"
      subtitle: "Before submitting your project, it's good to think over a few important points."
      introduction_html: "We know you can't wait to have your project online, but first answer <br> (on a piece of paper) the following questions."
      legend_html: "Having clear answers to these questions will help tremendously in structuring your project, <br>increasing the chances that it will be successful."
      title_one: "What inspired you to make this project?"
      tip_one: "People only engage when they realize the importance of a cause, so be very clear about what is your inspiration and let it flow into your project."
      title_two: "What is the focus?"
      tip_two: "EndlessCrowds is an excellent way to take the first steps towards a larger goal, so define the purpose of your project well, as well as who will benefit from it. Clearly defining your objectives is one of the best ways to engage people."
      title_three: "What is your goal?"
      tip_three: "Calculate all costs for the project execution and rewards delivery. Don't forget to take into account your ability to engage people in order to define your financial goal."
      title_four: "What is your deadline for the fundraising?"
      tip_four: "Don't underestimate the work it takes to run an EndlessCrowds campaign. You will have to work hard during the entire period the project is live, so, it's recommended that you don't tire yourself too much in this process. Our recommendation: 40 days at least."
      title_five: "Have you thought about the project rewards?"
      tip_five: "Remember that rewards are public promises, so think carefully when defining them, as well as the logistics in delivering them to your backers. Our suggestion: offer mostly immaterial rewards: downloads, e-hugs, etc."
      title_six: "Is your video ready?"
      tip_six: "The video is the business card of your project. It's through it that the backers will get in touch with your cause. So, take special care in the script, audio and image quality. HD is recommended."
      title_seven: "How will you mobilize your network?"
      tip_seven: "You need to have a clear idea on how you will stir your network and convince it to back your project. Distribute your work weekly and change your approach with the network according to how close you are to it."
      title_eight: "How will the money be used?"
      tip_eight: "Create a GOOGLE DOCS spreadsheet and open your budget to show everyone how the money will be used. TRANSPARENCY is everything."
      explore_curious: "Just looking around!"
      explore_projects: "I want to explore the projects."
      submit: "Next step!"
      send_project: "I want to submit my project."
